  <Description>This ornament is No. 830259. It is a little brown mouse, dressed in colorful clothes and wearing a Christmas decoration on its head, who is taking a flash picture with the camera, which is much bigger than the mouse! The camera is black and silver and has a green wreath with a red ribbon around the lens. The bulb in this camera really flahses - needs 2 AAA batteris (not included). 4" wide, 3 1/4" tall. Mint in Box condition. Buyer pays S/H of $3.75. Check out my other auctions and combine wins and save on shipping. Payment by PayPal, personal check, money order, cashier's check.

  <Description>This lamp is so Neat!! We found this upon moving, in an outback shed--it is an OLDIE!! This is apparently hand made ceramic. Works great. This has eight characters on it, and double sided, both sides have the same eight characters, from Frankenstein, Dracula, Laurel and Hardy, and others(maybe you know who they are). We can't decide the other characters. The top of the lamp is an old style film maker (camera) with the handle. This is approx. 30 inches tall without a shade on it(doesn't come with a shade or bulb). There are some paint chips, which I am sure could be touched up. There is a chip in the camera itself, maybe a small fill in and a touch of paint. The pink hat on the woman has also got a small chip, I would say same as camera(could be fixed nicely). There are no actual Cracks anywhere that I have found. I think it is a Wonderful memorabilia item for the movie lovers out there!! Payment can be made with credit card/checks via Paypal, Money order, cashiers check can be mailed. Take a look and see what you think. Sorry about the glare in some of the pictures. Buyer pays shipping (and insurance if desired) for this heavy piece. Have a Great Day and Happy Bidding!!!</Description>

A "shooting script" is very different from a transcript. A shooting script includes the cast list, set list, camera angles, off screen items, etc. This is what is given to the industry. It's 51 pages. The original was 3 hole punched but this copy has been placed in a "velo" bind with a clear plastic cover to protect it. This will make a **GREAT** christmas gift for any Buffy fan!!

  <Description>Original 11x14 Original 11x14" lobby card for the MGM Pictures film The Tartars 1961 starring Liana Orfei, Victor Mature View my other eBay auctions here Condition is fine or better with noted flaws being tape residue in borders . Color on this card is much brighter in most cases since the flash on my digital camera tends to wash out the colors. Buyer pays shipping of $4 within the US ($8 shipping for overseas). Win more than one auction and I will gladly combine shipping to save you money. Buy as many lobby cards as you want and only pay $4 total for shipping within the US!!
