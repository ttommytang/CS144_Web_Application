  <Description>This lamp is so Neat!! We found this upon moving, in an outback shed--it is an OLDIE!! This is apparently hand made ceramic. Works great. This has eight characters on it, and double sided, both sides have the same eight characters, from Frankenstein, Dracula, Laurel and Hardy, and others(maybe you know who they are). We can't decide the other characters. The top of the lamp is an old style film maker (camera) with the handle. This is approx. 30 inches tall without a shade on it(doesn't come with a shade or bulb). There are some paint chips, which I am sure could be touched up. There is a chip in the camera itself, maybe a small fill in and a touch of paint. The pink hat on the woman has also got a small chip, I would say same as camera(could be fixed nicely). There are no actual Cracks anywhere that I have found. I think it is a Wonderful memorabilia item for the movie lovers out there!! Payment can be made with credit card/checks via Paypal, Money order, cashiers check can be mailed. Take a look and see what you think. Sorry about the glare in some of the pictures. Buyer pays shipping (and insurance if desired) for this heavy piece. Have a Great Day and Happy Bidding!!!</Description>

  <Description>Here's a RARE chance to see SLAYER live with John Dette on drums during the UNDISPUTED ATTITUDE TOUR in 1996. This show is from some club in California (perhaps you know where), and features remarkable amateur 2 camera recording which has been seamlessly spliced together into what can only be described as a "near-professional" recording! One camera is on each side of the room, above the crowd--GREAT close-ups! The picture and sound are absolutely top notch as far as non-pros go. Definitely EXCELLENT quality here. Full set, approx. 90 minutes. High bidder must add $3.50 for shipping/handling. Payment must be made in MONEY ORDER FORM ONLY, and received by the seller within TEN days of auction's end, or negative feedback wil result immediately. HONEST BIDDERS ONLY!!! THANK YOU!
